 * These statements can have several forms (depending, for example, on whether

 * following forms:
 * - `__export(firstArg)`
 * - `__exportStar(firstArg)`
 * - `tslib.__export(firstArg, exports)`
 * - `tslib.__exportStar(firstArg, exports)`

 * In all cases, we only care about `firstArg`, which is the first argument of the re-export call
 * expression and can be either a `require('...')` call or an identifier (initialized via a
